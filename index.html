    <h3>what is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills?: </h3>
    <p>The last time I did anything related to web development was in middleschool, a site with a cyan background and red text that I used to express my pride in being able to explain the mechanics of sonoluminecence.</p>
    <h3>what do you hope to learn from this class?: </h3>
    <p>Enough to make a site for my own portfolio so that I won't need to go through anyone else</p>
    <h3>have you signed up for our course Campuswire forum?: </h3>
    <p>...yes</p>
    <h3>anecdote: </h3>
    <p>I was reading a thing and thinking to myself about how much I liked this one character, the way that they're universally hated because of their affinity for depicting suffering, the way that they are proud and compassionate and unwilling to sacrifice their individuality for the sake of social exceptance, when critisized by a royal they retorted, "unaccomplished artists can't see beauty in the ugly." Spiteful, the royal retaliates by killing the person my character was emotionally dependet on. I spent the next half hour staring at the wall, disturbed by the thought that my defining trait is the very thing that led my counterpart to such misery.</p>
